A calendar and event tracker powered by Google Calendar.

## Brainstorming!

This plugin is a HUGE work in progress. By that I mean, I'm not 100% sure where I want to go with this. I have some ideas that I want to look into (mentioned below), but I'm completely open to ideas. If you have any just jump into the Gitter chat and let me know!

## Ideas

Here's what I've have so far:

* Groups (managed by userclass) with access to specific calendar IDs.
* Menu item to display upcoming events.
  * One item that displays events relavent to any groups you exist in.
  * Allow users to define how many events they want to see.
  * Allow users to define whither or not they want to see events from certain groups or not.
* Calendar page that displays all the events, for all groups you are part of, for the current month.
  * Possibly allow for viewing of upcoming months as well.

That's all for now! I'm not really diving into the code until I get the direction ironed out, and I'm only commiting all this right now so that I can potentially get ideas from people that may use this plugin.
